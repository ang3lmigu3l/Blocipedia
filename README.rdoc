== blocipedia

An app that lets users view and create wikis.

There are three types of users: standard, premium and admin.

Users may upgrade their account to a premium account via a Stripe subscription.
Premium users may also downgrade their account to a standard one. 

Users with premium accounts may mark a wiki as private so that it will only be viewable by them or an admin.
